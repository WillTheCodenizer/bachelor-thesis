# fisherA2Z

## Introduction 00

FisherA2Z is a Fisher forecasting code initially developed by Husni Almoubayyed for his PhD thesis Chapter 4. Tianqing Zhang refurbished the code in 2024 and prepared Zhang et al in prep. "A2Z" stands for the initial of Almoubayyed and Zhang. 

This repository includes code used for the Fisher Information matrix computation used to assess the impact of photo-z modeling errors on 3x2pt inferences.

## Installation

First, initialize a conda environment by

```
conda create -n 'fisher_env' python=3.8
conda activate fisher_env
```

If you want to install from Pypi:

```pip install fisher-a2z```

If you want to install from source, clone the repository, and install by 

```
pip install -e .
```

Then you can add your conda environment to your jupyterLab by


```
conda install -c anaconda ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=fisher_env
```


## Code

The code described in the paper is in fisher.py, and the Fisher class therein.

We developed a latest and greatest module that can do forecast for any n(z) and its realizations, survey configuration like fsky, number density, and shape noise, defined in fisher_flex.py

The Fisher class takes a CCL cosmo object and 3 iterables of length 5 each to specify the photo-z error model in terms of biases, standard deviations, and outlier fractions. 


## Examples

### Flexible Fisher Forecast

To use the flexible fisher forecast, you need to define a bit more ingredient (but it is way more flexible)

```
from fisherA2Z.fisher_flex import FisherFlex
flex_y10_cs = FisherFlex(
    # -- the n(z) and its uncertainty ---------------------------------
    nz_source=nz_source,
    nz_realizations=nz_realizations,
    z_grid=z_grid,
    # -- the survey ---------------------------------------------------
    neff_source=[4, 5, 4, 2],   # arcmin^-2, per tomographic bin
    fsky=0.5,                   # ~0.5
    sigma_e=0.26,               # per-component ellipticity dispersion
    # -- the analysis -------------------------------------------------
    mode="cosmic_shear",        # or '2x2pt' / '3x2pt'
    nz_model="shift_stretch",   
)

flex_y10_cs.compute(parallel=True)

res_y10_cs = flex_y10_cs.forecast(ell_max_cs=1800, ell_min_cs=300)  # you can apply scale cuts here
```

See Tutorial_04 and Tutorial_05 for more examples on `FisherFlex`. 


### Original Fisher Forecast

To get the original fisher matrix for a certain case, it is sufficient to run

```
from fisher import Fisher
f = Fisher(cosmo=ccl_cosmo)
f.process()
```

then the Fisher information matrix will be stored in f.fisher. Also see Tutorial_01/02/03

Enjoy Fishering! 


<!-- ## Analysis

The fisher.py contains simple functions that can be ran on the Fisher class to do simple fisher matrix analysis, such as marginalizing over a set of parameters, or plotting 2-dimensional contours

[I have not included the following notebooks yet, they are mostly ready but require some cleaning]

The following notebooks show examples of running the code to get cosmological inferences, compare 2-D confidence contours, and assess the importance of different photo-z error model parameters on cosmological inferences. They are under the Analysis folder.

`fisher.ipynb` shows examples of running the Fisher class and computing simple analysis on the Fisher matrix. It also shows how 2-D Fisher contours compare between different probes and how the contours from our fiducial model compares with another LSST-realistic model in Fig 8 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07885.pdf.

`Photoz-density-estimation.ipynb` shows how the photo-z outliers were estimated using a KDE from FlexZBoost.

`pz_dists_used.ipynb` shows plots of the fiducial photo-z error models used for the source and lens samples

`lum_dep_IA.ipynb` shows the luminosity-dependent intrinsic alignment implementation

`3x2pt_interpretability.ipynb` notebook shows examples of how the Fisher matrix and a dataset of data-vectors are used to compute the importance of different photo-z error parameters on cosmological inferences, specifically on the bias induced in cosmological parameters when assuming a fixed incorrect photo-z model.

`3x2pt_tree.ipynb` notebook computes the interpretability metrics used in the feature importance computation. -->
